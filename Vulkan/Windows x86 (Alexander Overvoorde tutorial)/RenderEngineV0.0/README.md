# Vulkan render application: Alexander Overvoorde tutorial.
This project is a completed version of the vulkan application that I build following the Alexander Overvoorde tutorial.

I wanted to thank Alexander for the work he did.

Vulkan version: 1.1.82.0

IMPORTANT:
-Only works on x86 mode.
-The Visual Studio Project its configured for Vulkan SDK installed on C://, if you installed it in another path then you should change the include/libraries directories.
